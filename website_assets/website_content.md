**A Better Penn Station is Possible. And It Doesn't Cost $17 Billion.**

### Subheadline
Through-running can double Penn Station's capacity, improve passenger experience, and save taxpayers billions—all without massive construction disruption.

### Call to Action
**Demand an Independent Review**

## The Problem Section

### Section Title
**A Station at Breaking Point**

### Content
Penn Station serves over 650,000 passengers daily, making it the busiest transportation hub in North America. Yet commuters face a daily nightmare of overcrowded platforms, confusing layouts, and frequent delays. The current federal plan to address these problems involves spending $16.7 billion on a massive expansion that would demolish an entire city block and disrupt the community for decades.

This expansion plan is based on a flawed October 2024 feasibility study that dismissed through-running without proper analysis. The study was conducted by engineering firms with financial stakes in the larger project and was never subjected to independent review.

**Key Problems with Current Approach:**
- **Astronomical Cost**: $16.7 billion for expansion vs. $2-3 billion for through-running
- **Community Disruption**: Demolition of Block 780 displaces businesses and residents  
- **Construction Chaos**: Decades of disruptive construction in Manhattan's core
- **Biased Analysis**: Study conducted by firms with financial conflicts of interest

## The Solution Section

### Section Title
**The Power of Through-Running**

### Content
Through-running is a proven rail operation method where trains pass through a central station without terminating, continuing to destinations on the opposite side of the city. This simple operational change can double capacity while improving passenger experience and reducing costs.

**How Through-Running Works:**
Instead of trains arriving at Penn Station and reversing direction (requiring complex movements and long dwell times), trains would continue through the station to destinations across the region. A train from New Jersey could continue through Penn Station to Long Island, while a Long Island train could continue to New Jersey.

**Proven Benefits:**
- **Doubled Capacity**: Eliminates terminal bottlenecks and reduces dwell times
- **Massive Savings**: Costs 85% less than the proposed expansion
- **Better Service**: More frequent trains with direct cross-regional connections
- **Reduced Disruption**: Minimal construction compared to massive expansion

## Global Success Stories

### London Crossrail/Elizabeth Line
London's newest rail line demonstrates the transformative power of through-running. By connecting existing suburban lines through a new central tunnel, Crossrail dramatically increased capacity and improved passenger experience across the metropolitan area.

### Paris RER System
The RER (Réseau Express Régional) has served as the backbone of Paris regional transportation for decades. Through-running operations move millions of passengers daily across the metropolitan area with high frequency and reliability.

### Munich S-Bahn
Munich created what many consider the world's best medium-city transit system through through-running. The S-Bahn connects suburban lines through a central tunnel, providing metro-like service to 1.6 million people within 10 kilometers of the city center.

## The Evidence Section

### Current Federal Plan Problems
The April 2025 federal takeover of Penn Station planning has consolidated power under Amtrak and the Trump administration, but fundamental problems remain:

- **Biased Feasibility Study**: The October 2024 study dismissing through-running was conducted by WSP/FXC, firms with financial ties to the expansion project
- **No Independent Review**: The Federal Railroad Administration has never conducted an objective analysis of through-running alternatives
- **Predetermined Conclusions**: The study used assumptions that favored expansion over operational improvements

### Technical Feasibility
Through-running at Penn Station is not only possible but would be more efficient than current operations:

- **Reduced Track Requirements**: Through-running could operate with 12 tracks instead of the current 21
- **Improved Platform Utilization**: Platforms would be used more efficiently with continuous flow
- **Modern Signaling**: Advanced train control systems enable safe through-running operations
- **Proven Technology**: Successfully implemented in major rail hubs worldwide

## Take Action Section

### Contact Your Representatives
Penn Station's future affects millions of commuters and billions in taxpayer dollars. Your voice matters in demanding a fair, independent review of all alternatives.

**What You Can Do:**
1. **Contact the Federal Railroad Administration** and demand an independent review of through-running
2. **Write to your Congressional representatives** about the need for fiscal responsibility
3. **Share this information** with fellow commuters and concerned citizens
4. **Sign our petition** for an unbiased technical analysis

### Key Messages for Officials
- **Fiscal Responsibility**: Taxpayers deserve the most cost-effective solution
- **Technical Objectivity**: All alternatives must receive fair, independent analysis
- **Proven Solutions**: Through-running works in major cities worldwide
- **Environmental Impact**: Less disruptive construction benefits communities

## About the Campaign

### Mission Statement
We advocate for a comprehensive, independent review of through-running operations at Penn Station as a cost-effective, proven alternative to massive expansion. Our goal is to ensure that taxpayer dollars are spent wisely on solutions that truly serve the public interest.

### Why This Matters
Penn Station is more than a transportation hub—it's a critical piece of America's infrastructure that affects millions of lives and billions in economic activity. The decisions made today will impact generations of commuters and shape the future of regional transportation.

The current path toward a $16.7 billion expansion ignores proven, cost-effective alternatives that could deliver better results for less money. We believe the public deserves an honest, objective analysis of all options before committing to such massive expenditures.

### Coalition Partners
This campaign brings together transit advocates, fiscal conservatives, environmental groups, and concerned citizens who share a common goal: a better Penn Station that serves the public interest rather than private profits.

## FAQ Section

### What is through-running?
Through-running is a rail operation method where trains pass through a central station without terminating, continuing to destinations on the opposite side of the city or region.

### How much would through-running cost compared to expansion?
Through-running modifications would cost approximately $2-3 billion compared to $16.7 billion for the proposed expansion—a savings of over 85%.

### Has through-running been implemented elsewhere?
Yes, through-running is successfully used in major cities worldwide, including London (Crossrail), Paris (RER), Munich (S-Bahn), and many others.

### Would through-running really double capacity?
Yes, by eliminating the need for trains to reverse direction and reducing dwell times, through-running can effectively double the number of trains that can pass through the station per hour.

### What about the October 2024 feasibility study?
The study was conducted by engineering firms with financial stakes in the expansion project and used predetermined assumptions that favored expansion. It was never subjected to independent review.

### What can I do to help?
Contact your representatives, sign our petition, share information with others, and demand an independent review of through-running alternatives.
